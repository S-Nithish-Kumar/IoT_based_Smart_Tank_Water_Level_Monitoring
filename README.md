### 1. Problem Statement:
- Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease can cause vocal disorders leading to reduced
motor control for speech modulation due to limited physical sensations of speech.
+ The limited physical sensations of speech are due to the decline in Dopamine responsible for cognition.

### 2. Objectives:


### 3. Impact of Solving the Problem:
- Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of individuals worldwide.
In the United States alone, it is estimated that approximately one million people are currently living with
Parkinson's disease. However, this number is just a fraction of the global prevalence, as the disease impacts
an estimated ten million individuals worldwide.
+ According to research, 89 percent of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have speech and vocal impairments,
including hoarseness, breathiness, and a quiet, monotonous voice.
- A biofeedback device to module speech will help approximately 90 percent of the population with Parkinson’s
disease to improve their speech modulation.
* The device is not only useful for people with speech impairments related to PD but is also functional for
other vocal disorders with calibration as per the need.

### 6. Process Flow:
- Two microphones are used. One microphone will capture the user’s voice, and another will capture ambient noise.
- The signals from these two microphones will be filtered using a low-pass filter to remove spikes, and the filtered
data will be processed to provide feedback to the user.
+ A vibration motor is used to provide vibro-tactile feedback to the user. The vibration motor is tuned to produce
two different types of vibrations. Intermittent vibration prompts the user to reduce the volume, and continuous vibration
makes the user increase their voice.
* All the components will be placed inside a shoulder brace that can be worn on either shoulder.
